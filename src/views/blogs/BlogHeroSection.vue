                  <p class="font-inter text-base mb-5">Signal exists to provide people everywhere with a tool for real
                    private communication. That’s our
                    only goal, and we take it very seriously. We’re structured as a nonprofit to ensure that market
                    forces
                    can never put profit or expediency over the safety of those who rely on us. Our work also resonates
                    beyond the Signal app. The Signal Protocol has become the foundation for end-to-end encryption
                    technology that is used and trusted by many private messaging services to protect billions of
                    messages
                    every day.
                  </p>
                  <p class="font-inter text-base mb-5">We recognize that privacy is a human right and that free
                    expression
                    and the ability to dissent are
                    fundamental to a safe and vibrant society. But the current state of the Online Safety Bill in the UK
                    puts the future of privacy and expression in grave jeopardy.

                  <p class="font-inter text-base mb-5">The tech industry–its products, conceptual frameworks, linguistic
                    conventions, and cultural norms–is largely centered in the US (and, increasingly, China. But we’re
                    focused here on the US, where Signal is based). This is not because the US has better programmers or
                    more visionary entrepreneurs, but due primarily to historical material conditions. For example,
                    early investments in networked computation from the US military, which happened around the same time
                    that the US was becoming a global superpower, which was followed by the privatization and then
                    commercialization of networked computation, then the dot com boom, etc. etc., and here we are.
